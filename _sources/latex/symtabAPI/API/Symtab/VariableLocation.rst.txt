.. _VariableLocation:

Class VariableLocation
----------------------

The class is an encoding of the location of a variable in memory or
registers.

.. container:: apient

   typedef enum storageUnset, storageAddr, storageReg, storageRegOffset
   storageClass;

   typedef enum storageRefUnset, storageRef, storageNoRef
   storageRefClass;

   struct VariableLocation storageClass stClass; storageRefClass
   refClass; MachRegister mr_reg; long frameOffset; Address lowPC;
   Address hiPC;

A is valid within the address range represented by and . If these are 0
and (Address) -1, respectively, the is always valid.

The location represented by the can be determined by the user as
follows:

-  stClass == storageAddr

   refClass == storageRef
      The frameOffset member contains the address of a pointer to the
      variable.

   refClass == storageNoRef
      The frameOffset member contains the address of the variable.

-  stClass == storageReg

   refClass == storageRef
      The register named by mr_reg contains the address of the variable.

   refClass == storageNoRef
      The register named by mr_reg member contains the variable.

-  stClass == storageRegOffset

   refClass == storageRef
      The address computed by adding frameOffset to the contents of
      mr_reg contains a pointer to the variable.

   refClass == storageNoRef
      The address computed by adding frameOffset to the contents of
      mr_reg contains the variable.
