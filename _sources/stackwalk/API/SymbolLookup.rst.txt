Class SymbolLookup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The virtual class is an interface for associating a symbolic name with a
stack frame. Each object contains an address (the RA) pointing into the
function (or function-like object) that created its stack frame.
However, users do not always want to deal with addresses when symbolic
names are more convenient. This class is an interface for mapping a
objectâ€™s RA into a name.

In addition to getting a name, this class can also associate an opaque
object (via a ) with a Frame object. It is up to the implementation what
to return in this opaque object.

The default implementation of provided by StackwalkerAPI uses the tool
to lookup symbol names. It returns a Symbol object in the anonymous .
