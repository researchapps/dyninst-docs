Result Class
------------

A object represents a value computed by an AST.

The class is a tagged-union representation of the results that
Expressions can produce. It includes 8, 16, 32, 48, and 64 bit integers
(signed and unsigned), bit values, and single and double precision
floating point values. For each of these types, the value of a Result
may be undefined, or it may be a value within the range of the type.

The field is an enum that may contain any of the following values:

-  an unsigned 8-bit integer

-  a signed 8-bit integer

-  an unsigned 16-bit integer

-  a signed 16-bit integer

-  an unsigned 32-bit integer

-  a signed 32-bit integer

-  an unsigned 48-bit integer (IA32 pointers)

-  a signed 48-bit integer (IA32 pointers)

-  an unsigned 64-bit integer

-  a signed 64-bit integer

-  a single-precision float

-  a double-precision float

-  a single bit (individual flags)

-  a 512-bit memory value

-  a 128-bit integer, which often contains packed floating point values
   - a 14 byte memory value
